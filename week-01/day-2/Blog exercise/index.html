                                <p>If a picture is worth a thousand words, a video is worth a few million, easy. At least, that’s the current exchange rate. Our friends at Driving Line and Motegi Racing recently partnered up with our friends at R Compound USA, and our very own Khalil Kassem to produce “The Life of a Wheel.” From beginning to end, we’re shown the engineering, manufacturing, and design-oriented steps that go into producing a wheel, and in particular, Motegi Racing’s new forged MR408.</p>

                                 <p>When BMW introduced the E30 Touring back in the ’80s, they combined sport and utility to create a new wave of European wagons that were nimble, relatively quick, and nice to look at. It is no wonder then, that it’s successor, the E36, would get it’s own Touring model. About six years ago, Scott Paterson was the owner of two oldschool Minis that he was restoring together with his father. They were one of his first passions in the automotive world.</p>
